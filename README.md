# CS50: Introduction to Databases with SQL - Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from [**CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/) by Harvard University. The course dives into fundamental database concepts, focusing on how to effectively store, retrieve, and manage data using SQL.

## üìÇ [Problem Sets](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/psets/)

| Problem Set   | Topic      | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem Set 0 | Querying   | Write SQL queries to retrieve data from a single table.                                            |
| Problem Set 1 | Relating   | Write SQL queries to retrieve data from multiple tables.                                           |
| Problem Set 2 | Designing  | Design an ER diagram and Implement a database schema.                                              |
| Problem Set 3 | Writing    | Write SQL queries to insert, update, and delete data.                                              |
| Problem Set 4 | Viewing    | Write SQL queries to simplify complex queries using views.                                         |
| Problem Set 5 | Optimizing | Wirte SQL Indexes, Transactions, and Triggers to optimize database performance.                    |
| Problem Set 6 | Scaling    | Dealing with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other concepts such as stored procedures, replication and more |
